Introduction
============

The Temporal Logic Planning (TuLiP) Toolbox is a collection of
Python-based code for automatic synthesis of correct-by-construction
embedded control software as discussed in [1]_, [2]_.

The basic problem setup is sketched in :doc:`tutorial`.

Please also see `the wiki <http://tulip-control.sourceforge.net>`_ for
an overview and related links.  Though installation should be easy
(and standardized) through setup.py, there are some dependencies that
will need to be manually installed if not already available; details
are provided in :doc:`install`.  Note that *this documentation is
still under development*.  For help and support, please visit `our
support page
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/tulip-control/support>`_.
