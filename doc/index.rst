nTLP
====

...a permanent fork of `TuLiP <http://tulip-control.sourceforge.net>`_ that
removes use of MPT, yices, and JTLV, and will still follow relevant upstream
changes.  The citable URL is http://scottman.net/2013/nTLP

While most references in the documentation to "TuLiP" should be taken to mean
"nTLP", there are some obvious exceptions.
