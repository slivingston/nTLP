    Simulate an single automaton as a strategy
    
    Several Strategy-threads can be executed in parallel to simulate
    an asynchronous composition of automata. Shared variables are used to
    communicate.

    The output is only to stdout as formatted prints.
    
    Arguments to __init__ constructor:

    - `D` -- an Automaton object generated from the jtlvint.synthesize or
        jtlv.computeStrategy function.
    - `V` -- a dictionary in which the keys correspond to variable names and the
        values are the corresponding valuations. All variables that are either
        written or read by the automaton associated with this Strategy must be
        included in this dictionary. Note that if this Strategy is to be executed
        in Parallel with other Strategies, then they must all be assigned the
        same dictionary, as this is how shared variables are implemented.
    - `X` -- a list of variable names. The environment variables of the
        automaton. All variable names in `X` must be keys in `V`.
    - `Y` -- a list of variable names. The system variables of the
        automaton. All variable names in `Y` must be keys in `V`.
    - `name` -- name to identify the Strategy in the screen output.
    - `Tmin` -- minimum time between transitions (in ms)
    - `Tmax` -- maximum time between transitions (in ms)
    - `runtime` -- time in seconds to run the thread;
                   if 0 (default), then run indefinitely.
        
    Note: The automaton sleeps a certain amount of time between transitions.
           This time is a value chosen uniformly between `Tmin` and `Tmax`.
