# Gleaned from robot_simple_disturbance.py.  Polytopes may be given in
# V or H-representation (i.e., as a list of vertices the convex hull
# of which yields the polytope, or as a system of linear inequalities).
# If disturbance polytope W and dynamics matrix E are missing, they
# are assumed to be nil, i.e. no disturbances.  If horizon is omitted,
# it is assumed to be 10.
